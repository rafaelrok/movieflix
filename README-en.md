> Project has in turn to explore the deeper concepts of a REST API, based on technologies that involve the universe of JAVA with spring boot framework
> and its peculiarities, the project involves the following solution: a system for evaluating films scored by AI, which in turn will be used for educational purposes
> for resource exploration involving the java language, spring and OpenAI API, but with constant evolution of the API.

## Feature integration with OpenAI

In this last feature, integration with the OpenAI API was implemented, which in turn was used for movie evaluation purposes, as shown in the example below.
the AI analyzes the sentiment of the comment about the film, and returns a score from 0.0 to 5.0, where 0.0 is negative and 5.0 is positive, but in this range there is the variation
and in this variation, the score that would be the stars is set in the frontend. Frontend is not yet implemented.

#### Solution:
Optimize User Rating, where AI analyzes comment sentiment and returns a sentiment score.

## Prerequisites

The project tends to use the following technologies to exploit its features, such as JAVA JDK 11, spring boot 2.4.4, then followed by these
information, I intend to briefly update to current versions in order to explore even more new features.
Here are the main requirements to be able to clone and use the local project, before starting, make sure you have met the following requirements:
<!---These are example requirements only. Add, duplicate or remove as needed--->
* You should install the latest version: `Java JDK 11 / Spring Boot 2.4.4 / maven`
* Should have installed: `H2`
* Operating system: `Windows / Linux / Mac`
* Read the project documentation `(In development)`

- Then you must access the OpenAi website and create an account and generate an access key
   to be able to use the API, after that you must inform the access key in the file
   application.properties.

- After just running your application with spring-boot:run
```
Link to API documentation [OpenAI](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and create an account
